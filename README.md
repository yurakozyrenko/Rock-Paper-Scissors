The script generates a cryptographically strong random key (SecureRandom, RandomNumberGenerator, etc. - mandatory) with a length of at least 256 bits, makes own (computer's) move, calculates HMAC (based on SHA2 or SHA3) from the own move as a message with the generated key, displays the HMAC to the user. After that the user gets "menu" 1 - Stone, 2 - Scissors, ...., 0 - Exit. The user makes his choice (in case of incorrect input, the "menu" is displayed again). The script shows who won, the move of the computer and the original key.

Re-read the paragraph above, the sequence is critical (it simply doesn't make sense to do it differently, for example, showing the key before the user's turn or HMAC instead of the key).
Thus the user can check that the computer plays fair (did not change its move after the user's move).

When you select the "help" option in the terminal, you need to display a table (ASCII-graphic) that determines which move wins.

The table generation should be in a separate class, the definition of the "rules" who won should be in a separate class, the key generation and HMAC functions should be in a separate class (at least 4 classes in total). You should use the core class libraries and third-party libraries to the maximum, and not reinvent the wheel. Help should be formatted as an N + 1 by N + 1 table, where N is the number of moves (determined by the number of arguments passed to the script). +1 to add a title for the rows and a title for the columns (contain the title of the move). Cells can contain Win/Lose/Draw.

THE NUMBER OF MOVES CAN BE ARBITRARY (odd and > 1, depending on the passed parameters), it is not hardwired into the code.
Example:
>java -jar game.jar rock Spock paper lizard scissors
HMAC: 9ED68097B2D5D9A968E85BD7094C75D00F96680DC43CDD6918168A8F50DE8507
Available moves:
1 - rock
2 - Spock
3 - paper
4 - lizard
5 - scissors
0 - exit
? - help
Enter your move: 3
Your move: paper
Computer move: rock
You win!
